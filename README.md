Stand-alone program to delete orphaned files and convert photo attachments into regular attachments
Warning:  This program will delete files from the file folder in your phpfox installation.  It is supposed to only delete orphaned files, but it could delete others.  Make sure you have a full backup of your website before using this program.

It will also make changes to your database, if you select "Fix", that will make photo attachments into regular attachments.  For this reason, it would be wise to have a database backup before using this option.
